    <h1 class="title">Assignment 3 - Who I Would Like to Emulate</h1>
    <p class="description">
        Looking back at the references I included in my design brief and some that did not make the cut, one of the
        organizations that I would be interested in emulating is Weirdcore. Weirdcore is a London-based visual designer
        who is known for making offbeat visuals for established music artists. Within his portfolio, he made music
        videos and concert visuals for various musicians and bands; such as Aphex Twin, Gwen Stefani, Charli XCX, Tame
        Impala and several more.
        <br /> <br />
        One of the things that Weirdcore has in his portfolio is the clear conveyance of what he is able to achieve
        visually and conceptually through his exhibited works. Just by casually going through his thumbnails of his past
        works, a clear idea of what Weirdcore’s distinguishing characteristic might be can be formed within in one’s
        mind. Through the thumbnails of his portfolio, it is clear that he collaborates with established musicians to
        make offbeat visual content. That is something I want to achieve in my portfolio site, the ability to give a
        clear message about what I am able to do as a designer just by a quick glance of the site.
        <br /> <br />
        What most of Weirdcore’s works have in common with each other is the process of collaboration. Established names
        are often seen in the titles of his portfolio works. For instance, there are multiple examples within his
        portfolio that shows that he worked with Aphex Twin. His branding is often stands out, as evident by his
        frequent use of using his face on people and the sci-fi typographic-like logo. Based on what I saw from his
        portfolio, the offbeat nature of both Weirdcore and Aphex Twin fit well together; using their respective skills
        to create something large that fits within an artist’s branding.
